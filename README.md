# moodboxstyleguide
A sass grid framework/style guide for developers to make quick front-end applications without all that extra work. NOTE: This project has just begun, and is very sparce at the moment. Updates will be coming weekly. This is mainly a learning project for my own enjoyment.

Setup:

Requires sass

`gem install sass`

Sass watch:

`sass --watch application.scss:styles.css`
